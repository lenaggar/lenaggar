Hi there 👋 I'm a Web Software Engineer at [DataSnipper](https://www.datasnipper.com/) with over seven years of **Web Engineering** experience at various companies like [Miro](https://miro.com/), [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/) and [Seera](https://www.seera.sa/).

### A little backstory 🔙

My professional career started in 2012 working as an Asset Integrity Engineer in Oil and Gas. I leveraged Microsoft Excel a lot to streamline processes and drive efficiency in my teams' workflow.

For 4 years, I developed an interest in using software, I enjoyed telling computers what to do, and I felt passion for that specific aspect of my job at that time.

### My tech career story 👨🏻‍💻

In 2016, I switched careers to Tech where my Software Engineering journey set off. My experience working mainly with web technologies within B2C SaaS product companies exposed me to different work setups where I used different tools and technologies to create modern performant web applications.

Constantly, I find myself enjoying working on team-wide frontend platform improvements such as: build processes improvement, managing CI/CD pipelines, working with Product designers on unified design systems, creating automation scripts to enhance developers' workflow and productivity, etc.

### A new interest 👀

Recently, I have been investing a lot in learning Rust, and I am excited about leveraging it with WASM (web assembly) to create performance-heavy UIs.
